TUPLES IN PYTHON 
Tuples in Python 
A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. 
Tuples are just like lists with the exception that tuples cannot be changed once declared. 
Tuples are usually faster than lists.

"""
In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. 
However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. 
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
